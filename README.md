# Description
The first project I have ever made and it was for school, here is a little description for it:
This project is a Javafx based program which was designed for a family business in order to track and manage events more effectively using a an app and a SQL server. This app allows managers/admins to add events into the program which are saved in the database and can be viewed by the specified group of users indicated by the admin only. The program also allows for the users to confirm their presence to an event. All data is protected by a login and username.

# What I learned

How to connect to databases via java and basic SQL queries.
